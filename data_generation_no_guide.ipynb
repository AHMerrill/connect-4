    "# Connect4 MCTS Distribution Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook first builds a single rolling `mcts_distribution.npz` that aggregates MCTS root distributions per board.  \n",
    "    - The MCTS generated approx 500,000 unique board positions at rollout nsteps 2000.\n",
    "- Each data entry consists of the following:\n",
    "    - 6x7 Connect 4 board grid with +1 (player to move), -1 (opponent), 0 (empty).\n",
    "    - 6x7x2 Encoding (channel 0 = to-move; channel 1 = opponent).\n",
    "    - Length-7 raw visit count from the MCTS process (one for each possible connect 4 column).\n",
    "    - Length-7 net win scores from MCTS.\n",
    "    - Length-7 \"policy\", which is normalized visits and represents move probabilities.\n",
    "    - Length-7 \"Q\", which is the per move expected outcome.\n",
    "    - Length-1 \"value\", or single expected outcome for the board.\n",
    "- The last part of the code are cells to view random samples of boards from various stages of the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Key ideas:**\n",
    "- The number of random opening moves is sampled from a skewed distribution (4-14, mode 6) and not recorded. This preserves opening diversity.\n",
    "- After that, each board is labeled with a distribution over 7 moves for the player to move.\n",
    "- The code was run a few times with different numbers of RANDOM_OPENING_MOVES to try to increase strength in early, mid, and late stage boards\n",
    "- Repeated boards are accumulated (no deduping) so the distribution becomes an average over many MCTS runs.\n",
    "- Connect 4 has symmetry, so boards and their mirrors are equivalent. \n"
