    "# Connect4 MCTS Distribution Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook first builds a single rolling `mcts_distribution.npz` that aggregates MCTS root distributions per board.  \n",
    "    - The first MCTS generated approx 610,000 unique board positions at rollout nsteps 200.\n",
    "- Each data entry consists of the following:\n",
    "    - 6x7 Connect 4 board grid with +1 (player to move), -1 (opponent), 0 (empty).\n",
    "    - 6x7x2 Encoding (channel 0 = to-move; channel 1 = opponent).\n",
    "    - Length-7 raw visit count from the MCTS process (one for each possible connect 4 column).\n",
    "    - Length-7 net win scores from MCTS.\n",
    "    - Length-7 \"policy\", which is normalized visits and represents move probabilities.\n",
    "    - Length-7 \"Q\", which is the per move expected outcome.\n",
    "    - Length-1 \"value\", or single expected outcome for the board.\n",
    "- The top 61,000 boards were then refined at rollout nsteps 3000.\n",
    "    - This was done to combine breadth (many unique boards) with depth (label quality) of the initial data set.\n",
    "- We can then mirror this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Key ideas:**\n",
    "- The first two moves of each self-play game are random and not recorded. This preserves opening randomness.\n",
    "- After that, each board is labeled with a distribution over 7 moves for the player to move.\n",
    "- Repeated boards are accumulated (no deduping) so the distribution becomes an average over many MCTS runs.\n",
    "- An Opening-book is injected into the data as one-hot distributions.  This opening book uses https://connect4.gamesolver.org/, which is a mathematically formulated perfect connect 4 player by Pascal Pons.  The opening book is exactly 8 boards: The empty board (used if we play first), and 7 additional boards that represent responses to first moves (if we play second).\n",
    "- Connect 4 has symmetry, so boards and their mirrors are equivalent. \n"
